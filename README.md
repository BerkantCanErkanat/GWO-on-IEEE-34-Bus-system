# Gwo-on-IEEE-34-Bus-system

I worked with IEEE 34 Bus system on OpenDSS. This project is about finding the optimal position of regulators by using grey wolf optimization algorithm
so that all node voltages comply with IEEE standards. 

Special thanks to https://seyedalimirjalili.com/projects. For sharing GWO code implementation on Matlab.
